Hotel Bookings Data Analysis using Tableau
This repository contains an Analysis of hotel bookings data of Booking.com. The analysis focuses on identifying key trends and insights to help understand customer booking behaviors, cancellation rates, and other factors influencing hotel operations.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of hotel bookings data to uncover meaningful patterns and actionable insights. By examining various attributes of the dataset, we aim to address :

Booking patterns and lead times
Customer demographics and preferences
Popular room types and meal plans
Seasonal trends and their impact on reservations
Effectiveness of different booking channels

Dataset
The dataset includes detailed information on hotel bookings, with features such as:

Hotel type (City Hotel or Resort Hotel)
Booking status (Canceled or Not Canceled)
Arrival date
Lead time (days between booking and arrival)
Stayed in weekend/week nights
Number of guests (adults, children, babies)
Market segment
Room type
Customer demographics (country, age, etc.)
Special requests and more

Tools Used
The following tools were used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization:

Python: Data processing and manipulation
Pandas: Data cleaning and exploration
NumPy: Handling numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
Tableau: Data visulaisationa and analysis via dashboard

Key Insights
1. Booking Trends
Most bookings occur during the summer months, with the highest demand in July and August.
Resort hotels tend to experience higher seasonal fluctuations compared to city hotels.

2. Cancellations
A significant proportion of bookings are canceled, with the majority of cancellations linked to longer lead times.
Guests from certain countries tend to have higher cancellation rates, potentially due to visa issues or other travel constraints.

3. Lead Time Impact
Longer lead times are associated with higher cancellation rates, suggesting that booking commitments made well in advance may be less reliable.

4. Customer Preferences
Couples make up the largest group of hotel guests, and they generally prefer city hotels over resort hotels.
Customers who make special requests (such as room preferences) tend to have a lower cancellation rate.

Visualizations
The project includes multiple visualizations to support the findings:

Heatmaps to identify missing values
Box plot to identify outliers in the data
Pie chart to check hotel type booking preference
Bar charts for distribution channel analysis
Box plot to identify prefered month for booking
Bar chart for desired room type and country analysis
Interactive Tableau dashboard to understand the entire data and make inportant desicions upon the insights from the dasbboard

Conclusion
This Analysis provides valuable insights into hotel booking patterns and customer behavior. The results can be leveraged by hotel management to optimize room allocation, predict cancellations, and tailor marketing strategies to attract and retain guests.
